# Project Proposal

## Background
I aim to replicate supplemental experiment S4 of “Functional Smiles: Tools for Love, Sympathy, and War,” which was recently published in *Psychological Science* (Rychlowska et al., 2017). The paper examines features associated with reward, affiliative, and dominance smiles, and the information each type of smile signals to others. This work aligns well with my research interests, which investigate how cultural differences in “ideal affect,” or the emotions that people value, influence interpersonal judgments like trustworthiness and extraversion. While my research distinguishes between excited and calm smiles, this replication project will give me exposure to another way in which smiling expressions are categorized.

## Materials and Methods
To replicate supplemental experiment S4, approximately 70 participants will be recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants will complete an online categorization task, in which they view 75 images of targets that vary in ethnicity (White, African American), sex (male, female), and emotional expression (reward smile, affiliative smile, dominance smile, neutral, disgust). For each image, participants will indicate whether or not it contains a smile. The order of image presentation will be randomized.

The researchers made their facial stimuli accessible but there are two potential difficulties that could affect the replication. First, the researchers recruited participants on MTurk but did not specify whether they restricted worker requirements (e.g., location, approval rate). For instance, the researchers note that 69 of 73 participants were in the U.S., suggesting that worker location may not have been constrained. Secondly, the researchers included the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Inventory after the categorization task; these scales were intended for a separate study and as a result, they were not the focus of analysis. To keep the replication study design as similar as possible to that of the original study, I plan to include these scales. However, depending on the number of participants required and the available funds to pay them, the scales can be omitted to shorten the length of the study.
